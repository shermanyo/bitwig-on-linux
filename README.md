Bitwig contol scripts, libraries and related code.

Check out my blog for some background info and posts about the scripts I post here:

I'll try to link to any code or info that is used in my scripts. If you think I've lifted anything without referencing your work, let me know and I'll update and apologize :P

Anything here owes a huge thankyou to the following people / groups. If you like their stuff, support them where you can. If you like _my_ stuff, support them anyway. They are the ones that make it all possible.

Livid Instruments  - http://lividinstruments.com/
